**ABOUT**

Here at teach for tomorrow, we work towards organizing a community of such individuals who can spare some of their daily time for the betterment of lives of those who are a little less fortunate.
Itâ€™s a platform for people who are willing and passionate about teaching students for better tomorrow.


This project aims at bridging the gap among these passionate individuals and the ones who are unable to lift the costly burden of quality education.
Children living in slums and in small villages would be our prime beneficiary from sessions provided by people who are experienced in their skills and elementary subjects.
